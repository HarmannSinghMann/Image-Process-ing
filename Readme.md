# Image Processing - Without OpenCv

Hey , I have been using OpenCv extensively for the past few months and I thought its time for my own implementation of the Image Processing Filters using python.

# Filters: 
## 1. Brightness 
![](output/bright/princeton_small_brightness_0.jpg) ![](output/bright/princeton_small_brightness_0.5.jpg) ![](output/bright/princeton_small_brightness_2.0.jpg) 


## 3. Blurr
## 4. Edge Detection
## 5. Sharpen
## 6. Contrast
## 7. Composite


To run my code Kindly follow the Readme.txt
